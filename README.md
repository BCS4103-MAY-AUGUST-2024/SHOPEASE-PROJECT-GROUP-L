SHOPEASE PROJECT
For this project we obtained a sales and ecommerce dataset to be used for the project. We fed the data into 5 tables using psql. We then created routes for all the tables and implemented GET(retrieve), PUT(update), POST(add) and DELETE for each route. We then used swagger to create API documentation for all the endpoints.
